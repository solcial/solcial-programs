# Solcial Programs

Solcial on-chain program repository

All our Solana programs have been successfully audited by [Kudelski](https://kudelskisecurity.com/).
We promptly fixed all issues reported by the awesome team at Kudelski.

We now feel confident to release the source code of our program, once we are done with minor clean-up and documentation.
